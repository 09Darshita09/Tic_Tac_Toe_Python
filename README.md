A simple implementation of 2 player game - Tic Tac Toe in Juypter Notebook with Python

The steps to play the game are:

--> Player 1 gets to choose his/her symbol X or O.

--> Player will be asked to be ready to play.

--> The player who has the turn should choose a number between 1 to 9 to place his/her respective symbol on the board
